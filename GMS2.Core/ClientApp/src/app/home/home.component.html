            Music is a very large subject, and the advanced theory that students will want to pursue after mastering the basics will
            vary greatly. A trumpet player interested in jazz, a vocalist interested in early music, a pianist interested
            in classical composition, and a guitarist interested in world music, will all want to delve into very different
            facets of music theory.
