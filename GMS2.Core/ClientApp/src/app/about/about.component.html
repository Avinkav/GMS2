    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>A love of music is universal; from nine months to ninety, any age group can enjoy both playing and listening. Your child
      might not be the next Mozart, but all children can learn musical skills and benefit from them. Music uses both sides
      of the brain and is therefore valuable for development in all areas â€“ academically, physically, emotionally and spiritually.</p>

    <h3>Benefits of a Musical Education</h3>

          <h4>Music is academic</h4>
          <p>Musical theory trains the brain for higher forms of thinking and permanently enhances learning skills and capacity.</p>

          <h4>Music is physical</h4>
          <p>Playing instruments and keeping rhythm develops co-ordination and muscle control. Singing requires breath control.</p>

          <h4> Music is emotional</h4>
          <p>Music is an art form through which we express ourselves. We all need artistic, emotional outlets.</p>
